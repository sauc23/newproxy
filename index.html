        <h1>Goodbye.</h1>
        <p>We regret to inform you that the original owner of this site is no longer with us due to law enforcement matters unrelated to this service. However, we want to assure you that he is still alive.</p>
        <p>Due to the current circumstances, we have only one person managing the site, and with bills piling up, we have made the difficult decision to shut down the proxy service.</p>
        <p>We will be selling the site back to the original owner, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your support and for sticking around during this time. We appreciate each and every one of you.</p>
